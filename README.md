# human-services
An index of 18F and TTS work in the human services space
## Intro
- High-level overview of the human services workstream
  Over the last two years, several teams within TTS have worked on a number of projects that fall within the human services realm. This body of work has led to a deeper understanding of the challenges of the space from a variety of angles. We believe we can increase our potential for impact by approaching this as a cohesive body of work and making thoughtful choices about how and where we engage moving forward.
  
- How we engage in this space (TTS-wide, stuff from "Where and how we can help" in the short strat doc)
- Eventually goals and actions
- Work with us - how to get in touch
