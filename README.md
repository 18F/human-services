# 18F‚Äôs human services portfolio
This repo is an index of work in the human services space led by teams within GSA's [Technology Transformation Service (TTS)](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) (which includes [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/)).

## About the portfolio
Over the last two-plus years, several teams within TTS have worked on a number of projects that fall within the human services space. This body of work has led to a deeper understanding of the challenges of the space from a variety of angles. We believe we can increase our potential for impact by approaching this as a cohesive body of work and making thoughtful choices about how and where we engage moving forward.

### Our vision
We envision a world where:
- People actually receive the services they are eligible for.
- Government agencies of all levels work together effectively to deliver human services.
- State human services agencies operate efficiently, effectively, and sustainably.
- State workers are empowered to change how their agencies operate.
- Money spent on human services programs results in tangible value delivered.
- The marketplace of vendors and solutions serving these programs is accessible, vibrant and efficient.

### Our role in making this vision a reality
TTS is in a unique position to be a leader in this shift, influencing the ecosystem and its actors from a variety of angles due to our ability to work with agencies across the federal government, our experience supporting states through procurement consulting, our ongoing engagement with the vendor community, and our ability to build products and platforms for use across government. 

#### Where and how we can help:
- **Federal agencies:** We can help federal agencies achieve better outcomes by improving their methods for delivering policy, oversight, and funding (e.g. through APD reform, etc).
- **States:** We can help states administering federal programs with federal dollars increase their capacity to run these kinds of programs effectively through a variety of consulting and training activities (e.g. our work with Alaska Eligibility & Enrollment, CA Child Welfare).
- **The market:** We can influence the market of solutions, vendors who can play, and the methods and expectations of delivery.
- **The ecosystem:** We can contribute directly to the ecosystem of reusable, modular components in the marketplace.
- **The approach:** We can proactively and publicly share our lessons learned, crafting influential communications and materials that help shape the direction of the broader movement, even advocating for policy change where possible (what 18F has done for general best practices in gov tech, we can do specifically for the human services community).


## Current projects

We have worked with partners at the federal, state, and local levels learning about user needs from the beneficiaries in need of care to the federal agencies overseeing the programs, and experimenting with approaches to solve those problems.


### CA Child Welfare modular procurement
18F has been partnering with the California Child Welfare Digital Services (CWDS) team since 2015. CWDS is a collaboration of state and local government agencies dedicated to building a new child welfare information system that responds to users‚Äô needs while maintaining the best standards for security and data integrity. The goal is for CWDS to develop a strategy for building a new, intuitive, user-centric system that will have a direct impact on child safety, permanency, and well-being. The scope of the project includes supporting CWDS by providing hands on support to product owners, improving agile practices, and evaluating product and technical strategy.

### AK Eligibility & Enrollment (E&E)
Alaska Department of Health & Social Services, Division of Public Assistance (DPA) is developing a modern, integrated eligibility system that enables staff to more efficiently issue correct and timely benefits to Alaskans who need help meeting their basic needs.  Utilizing agile development and modular procurements, DPA has the goal of implementing an eligibility system that not only meets state and federal standards, but is user friendly for our clients, our eligibility staff, and our technical staff.

### VT E&E modernization
This project is meant to help Vermont to unwind from their legacy Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment system and introduce a more modular architecture and procurement approach. They have had a series of high profile rollout problems with a more traditional, waterfall-based approach to system integrator contracts going back to the original Medicaid expansion that happened with the ACA. In Year 2 we are hoping to ‚Äúreset‚Äù with them to focus on just a few things that will help them learn to work in a more iterative way without having to solve all of the things.

### HHS/CMS Advance Planning Document(APD) modernization
The project is to create a web form states can use to build and submit their APD in a standardized way.  The goal is to simplify the process for states by making the process formalized and well-defined, and to help CMS reach funding decisions more quickly so states spend less time waiting to find out if they‚Äôre getting money.

## Past Projects (WIP)

### AK Child Welfare modernization
The State of Alaska Office of Children‚Äôs Services (OCS) is starting process of transitioning from their legacy child welfare system to something that will meet the new CCWIS standard from ACF. In advance of this, OCS sought the assistance of the TTS Acquisition Team to develop an acquisition strategy to support to transition from the current system to a new CCWIS-compliant system. Developing a new acquisition strategy also entailed a review of their existing practices around procurement, software development and vendor engagement.

### USDA/SNAP State waiver path analysis
The USDA's Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) contracted with vendors to build a system to improve the process for States requesting waivers related to administering Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. With this system, they intend to reduce the time in the waiver decision making cycle, reduce inconsistencies across states, and increase customer service quality. The system would replace a paper process.

Unfortunately, work produced by the vendor did not meet FNS's requirements and FNS terminated the relationship. 18F will help FNS assess whether any of the work that they have is usable. We will also help set a path forward for a functioning system and for successfully managing it in the future.
