# TTSâ€™s human services workstream
This repo is an index of work in the human services space led by teams within GSA's [Technology Transformation Service (TTS)](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) (which includes [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/)).

## About the workstream
Over the last two-plus years, several teams within TTS have worked on a number of projects that fall within the human services space. This body of work has led to a deeper understanding of the challenges of the space from a variety of angles. We believe we can increase our potential for impact by approaching this as a cohesive body of work and making thoughtful choices about how and where we engage moving forward.

### Our vision
We envision a world where:
- People actually receive the services they are eligible for.
- Government agencies of all levels work together effectively to deliver human services.
- State human services agencies operate efficiently, effectively, and sustainably.
- State workers are empowered to change how their agencies operate.
- Money spent on human services programs results in tangible value delivered.
- The marketplace of vendors and solutions serving these programs is accessible, vibrant and efficient.

### Our role in making this vision a reality
TTS is in a unique position to be a leader in this shift, influencing the ecosystem and its actors from a variety of angles due to our ability to work with agencies across the federal government, our experience supporting states through procurement consulting, our ongoing engagement with the vendor community, and our ability to build products and platforms for use across government. 

#### Where and how we can help:
- **Federal agencies:** We can help federal agencies achieve better outcomes by improving their methods for delivering policy, oversight, and funding (e.g. through APD reform, etc).
- **States:** We can help states administering federal programs with federal dollars increase their capacity to run these kinds of programs effectively through a variety of consulting and training activities (e.g. our work with Alaska Eligibility & Enrollment, CA Child Welfare).
- **The market:** We can influence the market of solutions, vendors who can play, and the methods and expectations of delivery.
- **The ecosystem:** We can contribute directly to the ecosystem of reusable, modular components in the marketplace.
- **The approach:** We can proactively and publicly share our lessons learned, crafting influential communications and materials that help shape the direction of the broader movement, even advocating for policy change where possible (what 18F has done for general best practices in gov tech, we can do specifically for the human services community).

_Still to add:_  
- _Eventually goals and actions_
- _Work with us - how to get in touch_
- _Add links in the "where and how we can help" section to relevant work we've already done within each category_

## Current projects

We have worked with partners at the federal, state, and local levels learning about user needs from the beneficiaries in need of care to the federal agencies overseeing the programs, and experimenting with approaches to solve those problems.
