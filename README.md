# TTSâ€™s human services workstream
This repo is an index of work in the human services space led by teams within GSA's [Technology Transformation Service (TTS)](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) (which includes [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/)).

## About the workstream
Over the last two-plus years, several teams within TTS have worked on a number of projects that fall within the human services space. This body of work has led to a deeper understanding of the challenges of the space from a variety of angles. We believe we can increase our potential for impact by approaching this as a cohesive body of work and making thoughtful choices about how and where we engage moving forward.

_Still to add:_  
- _How we engage in this space (TTS-wide, stuff from "Where and how we can help" in the short strat doc)_
- _Eventually goals and actions_
- _Work with us - how to get in touch_

## Current projects

We have worked with partners at the federal, state, and local levels learning about user needs from the beneficiaries in need of care to the federal agencies overseeing the programs, and experimenting with approaches to solve those problems.
