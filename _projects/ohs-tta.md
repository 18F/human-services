categories:
- path analysis
- experiment and iterate
- assisted acquisition
- data platform

problems:
- Disconnected data systems which use manual & offline processes
- No complete picture of how TTA is used or success metrics
- Lack of clear & consistent reporting because planning and tracking is not coordinated

approach:
- Stakeholder and user research across levels and regions
- Scoping a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on real user stories
- Hiring a vendor to build the complete production system through an Assisted Acquisition

hypothesis:
- Centralizing the Training & Technical Assistance (TTA) request and activity tracking process will help elevate insights into TTA activities happening across their region and provide more effective help for their Head Start grantees.

## What we’ve learned so far

Today, much of the data related to TTA activity isn’t readily available to the TTA Central Office.
{:.project-quote}

### Communication is inefficient

Lack of integrated data sources make it hard to know what action is happening at glance. Communication is dependent on informal human systems.

### Lack of coordination

Lack of visibility in different parts of the system can result in duplication of efforts.

### Mismatch of resources and needs

Resources developed by the National Centers may not meet Regional needs as they shift from year to year.

### Progress is hard to quantify

It is difficult to measure or track any success metric over time.
